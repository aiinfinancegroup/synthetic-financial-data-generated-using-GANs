# synthetic exchange rate datasets
This repo containns synthetic financial datasets generated using four machine learning models
- GaussianCopula
- CTGAN
- TVAE
- CopulaGAN 

## Data Cleaning
The original data (exchange rates) was transformed to obatin the returns for reach currency returns using the relation 
$$S_t - B_t>0, \forall t,$$ 
where $S_t$ is the selling value, $B_t$ is the buying value of the currency, and $t$ is the time.

## Usage
The synthetic financial data provided in this repo has been evaluated and validated to be close to the real data. It can thus be used to test or evaluate trading strategies or models in a controlled environment.

- Backtesting
- Training
- Stress testing
- Forecasting the volatility of the currency returns

The example notebook can be closed and used to generate more synthetic datasets especially using the TVAE model that outperformed all the other models during our experiments.
